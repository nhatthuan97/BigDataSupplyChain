    "- **Destination Incoterm:** Incoterm governing GHSC-PSM’s agreement with the recipient\n",

    "- **OTD OTIF Exclusion Flag:** Flag (Y) indicating whether the line item should be excluded from delivery performance metrics, according to the approved policy for excluding line items from M&E Delivery Metrics. The policy allows for exclusions if 1) line item are explicitly excluded by USAID in a Technical Directive Memo, 2) line items are associated with previously delivered orders or special logistics processes (transfers, recall replacements, donations, etc.), or 3) line items do not represent delivery of commodities or services.\n",
    "- **In Full (IFD):** If no Shipped quantity, then blank. If shipped quantity ≥ ordered quantity, then “Y”. Otherwise “N”.\n",
    "- **On Time (OTD):** If there is no Revised Agreed Delivery Date, then blank. If no shipments have been delivered and the delivery window (-14/+7 calendar days) is not yet closed, then blank. If the delivery window has closed and no shipments have been delivered, then “N”. If all shipments have been delivered not on time, then “N”.

    "- **Between -30 and 30:** Same rules as [On Time (OTD)] within a -30/+30 day delivery window\n",
    "- **OTIF Categories:** On time In Full: The full ordered quantity of the line item is delivered within the delivery window (-14/+7). On time not in full: Some but not all of the ordered quantity was delivered within the window. Can occur with split lines, where some shipments fall within the window and some outside, or with short-shipped lines, where the shipped quantity is less than the ordered quantity. Not on time in full: All shipments were delivered outside the delivery window, but the shipped quantity ≥ ordered quantity. Not on time not in full: All shipments are delivered outside the delivery window and the shipped quantity ≤ ordered quantity. If there are any shipment bookings associated with the line item, this field will populate as soon as the delivery window closes, even if the line item has undelivered shipments.\n",
    "- **OTIF Between -14 and 14:** Same rules as [OTIF Categories] within a -14/+14 day delivery window\n",
    "- **OTIF Between -30 and 30:** Same rules as [OTIF Categories] within a -30/+30 day delivery window\n",

    "- **Number of Shipments:** Number of LMIS bookings in any status associated with a line item.\n",
    "- **Delivery Progress:** 0 – No associated bookings have been delivered. 1 – Some but not all associated bookings have been delivered. 2 – All associated bookings have been delivered\n",
    "- **Line Delivery Status:** Blank – Line item does not have an Agreed Delivery Date (ADD), so timeliness cannot be determined. Delivered – Early: All delivered shipments associated with this line were delivered early. Delivered – On time: At least one shipment associated with the line item was delivered on time. Delivered – Late: All delivered shipments associated with this line were delivered late. Undelivered: All shipments associated with this line item have not yet been delivered, and the on-time delivery window has not yet closed. Status will be updated as shipments are delivered and/or the delivery window closes. Undelivered – Late: All shipments associated with this line item have not yet been delivered, and the on-time delivery window has closed. This means the line item cannot be delivered on-time given the current ADD. On Hold – Line item is in a WCS hold status.\n",

    "### Reason Code\n",
    "Reason codes explain a change in the anticipated timing of a delivery. Acceptable delays (AD codes) are unforeseeable delays that are beyond GHSC-PSM’s manageable control. They are considered acceptable reasons to change the Agreed Delivery Date (ADD), with USAID mission or COR approval. Unacceptable delays (UD codes) are foreseeable or within GHSC-PSM’s manageable control. They are not valid reasons to change a delivery commitment (i.e. the ADD), but may be used when updating the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD). Supplier delays (SD codes) are an additional set of codes used to explain changes in supplier goods availability or delivery timelines.\n",
